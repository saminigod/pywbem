    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The DMTF CIM/XML Pull operations allow the WBEM client to break the monolithic instance operations for requests that deliver multiple objects into multiple requests/responses executed as a sequence of requests to limit the size of individual responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The pull operations were added to PyWBEM in version 0.9.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "They were created to reduce scalability issues with extremely large responses from the enumerate requests for instances (EnumerateInstances, Associators, and References) that were causing resource problems in both clients and servers by allowing the client to break large responses up into multiple smaller responses and allowing some filter of the responses to be performed by the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central concept of pulled enumeration operations is the `enumeration session`, which provides a context in which the operations perform their work and which determines the set of instances or instance paths to be returned. To process the operations of an enumeration session, some parameters of the open operation need to be maintained as long as the enumeration session is open. In addition, some state data about where the enumeration session is with regard to instances or instance paths already .returned must be maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "A successful `Open...` operation establishes the enumeration session and returns an enumeration context value representing it. This value is used as an input/output parameter in subsequent Pull operations on that enumeration session.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general they replace the single request/response (ex. EnumerateInstances) that returns all instances in a single response  with a pattern that is based on two operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Open...` to open the request enumeration session to the WBEM Server and \n",
    "* `Pull...` to continue retrieving objects from the WBEM Server after a successful `Open...`. The client continues\n",
    "to pull until an exception or end-of-sequence flag is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "They use the same request parameters and the original operations and add several more parameters to control the flow of responses (response size, timeouts, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relation to original operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The convention for the pull operation nameing was as follows 1) Prepend the original operation name with `Open` and\n",
    "`Pull`, 2) Suffix the pull operations that return both instances and paths with `WithPath`, 3) Change the name suffix on operations that return path information from `Names` to `Paths` to reflect that these operations are returning \n",
    "complete instance paths with host and namespace included.  The `Exec` was dropped from the name for the\n",
    "`OpenQueryInstances`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CIM/XML pull operations parallel to the previous CIM/XML operations as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "*Original Operation*   | *Equivalent Pull Operations*\n",
    " :-                    |:-\n",
    "EnumerateInstances     | OpenEnumerateInstances / PullInstancesWithPath \n",
    "EnumerateInstanceNames | OpenEnumerateInstancePaths / PullInstancesPaths\n",
    "Associators            | OpenAssociatorInstances / PullInstancesWithPath \n",
    "AssociatorNames        | OpenAssociatorPaths / PullInstancesPaths\n",
    "References             | OpenReferenceInstances / PullInstancesWithPath \n",
    "ReferenceNames         | OpenReferencesPaths / PullInstancesPaths\n",
    "ExecQuery              | OpenQueryInstances / PullInstances\n",
    "\n",
    "The pull operations are defined only for instances.  There are NO pull operations for CIMClasses, the\n",
    "CIMQualifierDeclarations or for the InvokeMethod\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pull Operation Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pull operation request returns a Python named tuple result that consists of the following named components:    \n",
    "\n",
    "* *`eos`* - A boolean flag that indicates end-of-sequence. As along as this returned flag is True, the server has more objects to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `context` - An opaque identifier that must be returned to the server with subsequent pull requests to continue the enumeration sequence. The context received with a response within an enumeration MUST be returned with the next request since the context may uniquely define not only the enumeration sequence but the segement to be returned in the next request\n",
    "\n",
    "* `instances` or `*paths*` - A list of pywbem objects returned from the server.  The requests that demand instances return the `*instances*` entry in the tuple and those that request paths return paths in the `path` object in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pull Request Sequence Code Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally the pattern for requesting from a server using the Pull operations is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    # open the enumeration sequence\n",
    "    result = open...(uri, ...)\n",
    "        ... process the objects return in result.xx\n",
    "    # while more objects exist in the server, loop to pull objects\n",
    "    while not result.eos\n",
    "        result = pull...(result.context, <MaxObjectCount>, ...)\n",
    "            ... process the objects return in result.xx\n",
    "            \n",
    "The user opens the request with the open request and if that is successful, and does not return the end-of-sequence flag\n",
    "the result (`eos`) executed the pull request to continue receiving objects within the enumeration sequence.  Each pull\n",
    "request MUST include the enumeration context from the previous response (`context` in the result tuple).\n",
    "\n",
    "The pull sequence may be terminated by executing a [`CloseEnumeration()`](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#pywbem.WBEMConnection.CloseEnumerate)\n",
    "to terminate the pull sequence.  However, this is optional and used only to close pull sequences before the `eos` has\n",
    "been received.\n",

    "### Common Pull Operation Request Input Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the request arguments that are common across all of the Pull requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OpenRequests\n",
    "\n",
    "* `FilterQuery Language` and `FilterQuery` - These input parameters specify a filter query that acts as an additional restricting filter on the set of enumerated instances/paths returned. WBEM servers must support filter queries in pulled enumerations and must support the DMTF Filter Query Language(FQL, see  DMTF DSP0212) as a query language. If a WBEM server accepts a request with the `FilterQuery` parameter defined it MUST filter the response.  NOTE: The query and query language defined for the `OpenQueryInstances` is NOT FQL but the same query languages defined for the execQuery request. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `OperationTimeout` - Determines the minimum time the WBEM server shall maintain the opened enumeration session after the last Open or Pull operation (unless the enumeration session is closed during the last operation). If the operation timeout is exceeded, the WBEM server may close the enumeration session at any time, releasing any resources allocated to the enumeration session. An OperationTimeout of 0 means that there is no operation timeout. That is, the enumeration session is never closed based on time. If OperationTimeout is NULL, the WBEM server shall choose an operation timeout.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ContinueOnError` - This input parameter, if true, requests a continuation on error, which is the ability to resume an enumeration session successfully after a Pull operation returns an error. If a WBEM server does not support continuation on error and ContinueOnError is true, it shall return a failure with the status code CIM_ERR_CONTINUATION_ON_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `MaxObjectCount` - Defines the maximum number of instances or instance paths that the open operation can return. Any uint32 number is valid, including 0. The WBEM server may deliver any number of instances or instance paths up to MaxObjectCount but shall not deliver more than MaxObjectCount elements. The default for this is zero so that the WBEM server does not deliver objects in the response unless a MaxObjectCount is specifically defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PullRequests\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Context` - This is the EnumerationContext defined in the specification. It is an opaque string returned from the previous open or pull for this enumeration sequence as part of the result tuple (result.context).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `MaxObjectCount` - This  required input parameter defines the maximum number of instances or instance paths that may be returned by this Pull operation. Any uint32 number is valid, including 0. The WBEM server may deliver any number of instances or instance paths up to MaxObjectCount but shall not deliver more than MaxObjectCount. The WBEM client may use a MaxObjectCount value of 0 to restart the operation timeout for the enumeration session when it does not need to not retrieve any instances or instance paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CloseRequest\n",
    "* `Context` - This is the EnumerationContext defined in the specification. It is an opaque string returned from the previous open or pull for this enumeration sequence as part of the result tuple (result.context)."
